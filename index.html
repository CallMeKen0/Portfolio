          Hello and thank you for visiting my e-portfolio! I am Kenneth A. Baldomar,1st Year Student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Caraga State University. I am 20 years old and i was born on the 12th of July 2003.Im an ambitious and devoted IT student with a profound love for technology and its ability to bring about positive change. My fascination with the rapidly evolving world of information technology began at a young age and has motivated me to continuously expand my knowledge in this field. My journey into the IT realm sparked from a curiosity about the inner workings of computers and a fascination with the complexity of software applications. As I delved deeper, I realized the immense potential for IT to transform industries, streamline processes, and solve intricate problems. My passion for IT goes beyond the classroom; it is a driving force that propels me to constantly seek out new technologies and take on challenges with enthusiasm.
